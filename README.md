# securitylist

The securitylist repo is a superset of the NVD NIST database (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/data-feeds) that includes:

* The NVD data in JSON format
* Enrichment of the data (additional links, etc.)
* RESERVED CVE identifiers that are public from trusted sources but not yet in the NVD database ("STATE": "RESERVED")
